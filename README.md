# bitbuckethighlighter
This Chrome extension aims to fullfill the lack of syntax highlighting in Bitbucket Pull Requests. Automatically analyzes the extension of the file being displayed and performs a simple line-by-line syntax highlight. It currently supports JavaScript and Python, more to come soon. Only available in dark mode by far.
